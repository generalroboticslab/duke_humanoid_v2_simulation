"""Restores the log_metrics protocol dropped from vanilla mjlab's RewardManager.

Problem:
    RewardManager.compute() skips weight=0 terms entirely (`continue`). Some
    class-based reward terms need to log monitoring scalars (e.g. running means)
    even when their weight is 0 — the penalty must not be computed (no gradient,
    no cost), but the metric side-effect still must run every step.

Solution:
    A term opts in by implementing `log_metrics(env: ManagerBasedRlEnv) -> None`.
    Patched compute() calls it in place of `__call__` when weight == 0.0, instead
    of just skipping the term.

Consumers: mj_envs/tasks/humanoid_velocity/reward.py implements log_metrics on
foot_impact_velocity_mean, foot_step_asymmetry_mean, peak_height_mean.

Mechanism: monkeypatches RewardManager.compute directly on the shared class
object (`RewardManager.compute = _patched_compute`), rather than replacing the
class via subclass + dual-rebind. RewardManager's instance shape is unchanged
(no __init__ override needed), so mutating the method in place is enough — every
existing reference to the name `RewardManager` (mjlab.managers.reward_manager,
mjlab.envs.manager_based_rl_env) already points at this same class object, so no
second rebind is required the way ChronologicalObservationManager needs one.
