class ManagerBasedRlEnvWithFinalObs(ManagerBasedRlEnv):
    """ManagerBasedRlEnv that captures final (pre-reset) observations.

    Standard ManagerBasedRlEnv resets terminated envs BEFORE computing observations,
    so terminal state observations are lost. This subclass computes observations
    between termination detection and reset, storing them for off-policy algorithms
    that need pre-reset obs for proper value bootstrapping.

    SNAPSHOT INVARIANT (load-bearing — do not remove the clone in step()):
        `obs_buf` and `final_obs` returned from step() MUST be standalone tensors, not
        views into the observation manager's storage. The new ChronologicalObservationManager
        returns each group's obs as a VIEW into a persistent ring buffer that step() overwrites
        IN PLACE every call (zero-alloc by design). An off-policy runner carries obs across the
        collection loop (`actor_obs = next_actor_obs`) and stores them in a replay buffer; if
        those are views, the NEXT step() silently mutates already-stored transitions — the
        stored "current obs" becomes s_{t+1} while its paired action was chosen for s_t. The
        resulting (s_{t+1}, a_for_s_t, r, s_{t+1}) tuples corrupt the Bellman target -> value
        divergence -> training collapse, while on-policy/inference (which consume obs
        immediately and never carry them) look perfectly fine. The legacy mjlab manager
        returned a freshly-cat'd tensor each step, so this invariant held implicitly; the obs
        rewrite (dfd9d9f) broke it. step() restores it by cloning obs_buf at the env boundary.
