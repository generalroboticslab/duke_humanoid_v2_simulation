"""Batched, deploy-safe base+camera control primitives (ONE mechanism: parallel sim AND real robot).

Pure-tensor control logic on top of ``camera_perception`` (which already holds the batched perception
primitives). Kept free of mujoco / mjlab / env imports so it is unit-testable in isolation (run this file
directly) and runs unchanged on hardware -- the ONLY difference between sim and robot is the measurement
SOURCE feeding these functions (GT ``fov_detect`` / belief in sim; AprilTag+PnP / encoder FK on the
robot), never the control math.

Deployability rule (why base frame, why no world pose):
  - ``gaze_aim`` takes the target and the camera lens position BOTH in the base frame. On hardware the
    lens position comes from gimbal-encoder forward kinematics (base<-camera) and the target from the
    belief / AprilTag -- the absolute world base pose CANCELS, so no world frame is needed. In sim the
    env supplies the identical base-frame numbers (world frame cancels the same way). Never reads a world
    ground-truth object pose -> honest ("do not cheat").
  - ``mover_twist`` consumes only the target BEARING in the base frame and emits a body-frame twist
    (vx, vy, wz) -- the same command surface the deploy locomotion policy already consumes.

Batching: every function is elementwise over a leading ``[N]`` env axis (and ``[K]`` cameras for the
gaze/see paths); there is no python per-env loop and no ``[0]`` scalar collapse. ``mover_twist`` is a
functional batched port of the ``HeuristicMovingPolicy`` state machine -- state is carried in a
``MoverState`` of ``[N]`` tensors and every transition is a ``torch.where`` (no python branch on env).

Yaw-sign note: ``gaze_aim`` uses ``yaw = atan2(-sign*d_y, sign*d_x)``. The ``-`` on d_y is REQUIRED --
the compiled gimbal (both the standalone ``duke_v2/head_camera_dual.xml`` and the humanoid-attached
build) swings the optical axis toward -y for a POSITIVE yaw joint; the older ``atan2(sign*d_y, sign*d_x)``
only agreed with FK at yaw=0 and mis-aimed up to ~57 deg off-axis. Verified against the compiled model.
