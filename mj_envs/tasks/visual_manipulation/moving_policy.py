"""Heuristic base-motion policy: walk the humanoid until a target is arm-reachable.

Two pieces, composed by pickplace_reach_env.py's --walk mission:

  ReachabilityGate      -- answers "could the arm reach this target from where the
                           robot stands right now?" with the learned per-arm
                           reachability scorers (utils/reachability.py).
  HeuristicMovingPolicy -- turns that verdict into base velocity commands:
                           TURN (align to the latched drive direction) -> WALK ->
                           STOP (latched).

Ported from the moving policy running on the real Duke V2 humanoid
(visual_servoing repo, visual_navigator.ProportionalNavPolicy), with three
deliberate changes for this sim deliverable:

  * Drive directions are per-robot, not hardcoded (``drive_dirs``). The original
    "NO turning in place" directive assumed the opposed head-camera pair, which
    lets a target in either half-plane be approached without rotating: V2-fixed
    still runs that way on (+X, -X), and actuated V2 adds (+/-Y) to crab at a
    lateral cube. But g1 has ONE fixed forward camera and a single (+X)
    direction, so it must physically turn to see and to approach -- hence the
    real TURN state and its ``turn_wz_min`` floor. Turning in place is now a
    normal phase, not an excluded one.
  * Arrival is decided by the ReachabilityGate -- "the object entered the arm's
    reach envelope" -- not by a fixed arrival distance. A geometric backstop at
    the validated close-reach distance still exists as a safety net.
  * Lateral velocity is a CAPPED cross-track correction, WALK phase only
    (CRUISE_VY_MAX = 0.6 m/s) -- an explicit,
    user-directed override of the earlier "always zero" premise. The prior
    finding (uncapped free-strafe destabilises the walking policy, both sim
    and real -- visual_navigator.py) still holds and is NOT retested here;
    this is a small bounded correction toward the target's own base-frame y,
    not a free-strafe cruise.

Frozen-policy compatibility notes (why the numbers are what they are):
  * Cruise is a CONSTANT magnitude -- the user-verified stable walking speed --
    in every declared direction (v83's training range is symmetric, lin_vel_x
    in +-1.0). No proportional slow-down on approach: v83 has a low-speed dead
    zone (commands under ~0.1 m/s produce stepping-in-place), so a taper would
    stall the robot short of the reach envelope. (An opt-in WALK-only taper
    exists behind ``taper_dist_m`` / ``WALK_TAPER_DIST_M``; off by default.)
  * The same dead zone is why yaw has a FLOOR, not just a cap: a decaying
    proportional command crawls below what the base will act on, so
    ``TURN_WZ_MIN`` holds the rate up until the heading error is inside
    ``FACE_TOL_RAD``.

The class constants below are authoritative: ``__init__`` builds a ``MoverCfg``
from them, OVERWRITING that dataclass's own defaults. Read the values here, not
in ``control_vec.MoverCfg`` -- several of its defaults are dead for this path
and have already drifted.

    """Latched "target is arm-reachable from here" verdict for one target.

    Scoring recipe (mirrors how this repo already treats reachability, see
    grasp_planning.py): sample N_CANDIDATES grasp-plausible EE poses around the
    target (upper-hemisphere approach directions, random roll), score them with
    BOTH per-arm models, and take the max. A single identity-orientation query
    would be wrong twice over: only ~0.8% of feasible cache poses are near
    identity, and an identity wrist is not a grasp pose.

    TWO standoff rings must BOTH pass FOR THE SAME ARM (max over arms of min
    over rings of max over poses):
      0.15 m -- the repo's grasp standoff: wrist there = fingers AT the target;
      0.05 m -- wrist essentially at the target: the reach-demo "EE reaches the
                cube" standard.
    A distance sweep against the arm's anatomy showed the single 0.15 m ring
    admits stances where the fingers can touch the cube but the wrist can NOT
    reach its center (score cliff 0.52->0.56 m vs 0.44->0.48 m base-to-cube;
    both cliffs match the ~0.59 m straight-arm envelope). Requiring both rings
    per arm makes the stop unambiguous under either definition for ~4 cm of
    extra walk, and yields the ARM CHOICE for free: ``best_arm`` is the arm
    whose own both-ring score won, and ``latched_arm`` freezes that choice at
    the moment the gate fires -- the mission reaches with THAT arm, so the stop
    decision and the reach execution can never disagree about which arm.

    The verdict latches: SCORE_THRESHOLD must hold for CONSECUTIVE_HITS steps
    (debounce against flicker at the envelope boundary), and once latched it
    never un-latches -- the robot must not stop-start on the boundary.

    Honest scope: the scorers know kinematics + self-collision only (trained on
    the safe-arm-pose cache). They know nothing about the table as an obstacle;
    the geometric floor and the scene design carry that concern.

class HeuristicMovingPolicy:
    """Select nearest configured direction, then TURN/WALK/STOP toward one target.

    compute() maps the target's position in the BASE frame to a body-frame twist
    (vx, vy, wz); vy is a capped proportional cross-track correction toward the
    target's own base-frame y, active only in WALK (see module docstring,
    CRUISE_VY_MAX/K_LATERAL). All channels pass through an acceleration limiter
    (MAX_ACCEL, matching the real robot's RateLimiter) so starts and stops are
    ~0.1 s ramps, never steps.

    A PREFERRED DRIVE DIRECTION is a body-frame unit vector; the robot declares a
    SET of them (``drive_dirs``). Each direction ``d`` has a body angle
    ``phi = atan2(dy, dx)`` and a translational vector. Forward/backward/lateral
    directions are all valid.

    ONE direction is picked per target, on the first compute() after retarget(): the one
    minimizing the turn ``|wrap(bearing - phi)|`` to bring the target onto it
    (ties -> lowest index). Its ``phi`` and drive vector latch for the target. The
    default ``{front, back}`` recovers the old bidirectional FACING CHOICE (a rear
    target latches the back facing, drive backward); a single-facing robot
    ``{front}`` must TURN ~180 deg to face a rear target.

    NOT byte-identical to the earlier no-turn walk (the ``acdf637`` "no-turn
    bidirectional walk per user redesign"): that version drove at CRUISE_VX from
    step 0 while steering. This one first TURNs in place (vx 0) until the heading
    error is under FACE_TOL_RAD, so an off-facing target incurs a short turn-in-
    place before translating. Caller MUST recompute the base-frame target each step
    (the base rotates), else the TURN heading error never nulls and WALK is never
    reached. If the pure no-turn walk is wanted, drive with a single wide facing or
    restore the acdf637 compute() -- design choice, not covered here.

    States:
      TURN -- vx 0, steer toward the latched facing at K_STEER*err, capped at
              TURN_WZ_MAX and FLOORED at TURN_WZ_MIN while the error is still
              outside FACE_TOL_RAD (the proportional term decays below the base's
              yaw dead zone otherwise, and the turn crawls). Hands off to WALK
              after SETTLE_STEPS consecutive steps with the heading error under
              FACE_TOL_RAD AND the yaw ramp CONVERGED TO ITS COMMAND
              (|wz - want_wz| < wz_eps). Note the guard is convergence, NOT
              |wz| ~ 0: inside the tolerance band a proportional law still asks
              for a small nonzero want_wz, so an |wz| ~ 0 test is unsatisfiable
              and TURN deadlocks -- see control_vec.mover_twist.
      WALK -- translate along the selected configured direction; in-stride steering
              (WALK_WZ_MAX cap) holds the target on that direction.
